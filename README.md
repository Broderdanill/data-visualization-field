# Data Visualization Field with .arviz-files
This repository will contain not working code under development


# Information about .arviz
Use "Visualizer.jar" and BasePlugin from BMC
.arviz = zip containing "manifest.json" and "index.html" in a folder with same name as the definition name.

No custom .java-classes are needed if you only going to build HTML/JS via EventDispatcher
